Task-Manager-on-GAE--PHP-
=========================
# Task Manager

Building this as a free tool for startups. This is being built on Google Apps Engine. I'm using the PHP SDK.

How the tool works?:

 - Visit the GAE link.
 - Log into the app using GAE.
 - Create a team
 - Invite team members (not developed yet)
 - Create tasks
 - Assign tasks to your team members
 - View your team members' task list (not built yet)
 - View their progress and help them  (not built yet)
 - Add description to a task and track / record its progress (developing at the moment, feel free to chip in)
